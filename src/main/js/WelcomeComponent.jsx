				Pencyl is an application that helps you take notes and reflect on your past thoughts. Unlike other note applications, Pencyl will periodically give you a gentle nudge to review your previous entries by entering the <b>Reflect</b> mode. In Reflect mode, Pencyl uses an algorithm to find notes you havenâ€™t seen or interacted with in a while, making sure that over time you get to see and interact with all of your previous thoughts. You can also access Reflect mode through the menu. Happy Notetaking!
